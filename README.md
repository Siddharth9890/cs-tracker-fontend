# CS-Tracker

**CS-Tracker** is relaunched with the aim to simplify the DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) learning experience.

## Key Features:
- **No Backend**: We have removed the backend, and now all data is stored locally in the user's browser.
- **Privacy Focused**: Since all data is stored in your local browser, there is no data tracking, ensuring your privacy.
- **Lightweight**: The app runs directly in the browser, making it fast and easy to use.

## Current Status:
This is a **proof of concept (PoC)** and will be improved further with:
- More features
- Better code quality
- Enhanced user experience

Stay tuned for future updates!
